# Emoji-Pass

**Your face is your password.** Emoji-Pass turns facial expressions into a sequence of emojis you ‚Äútype‚Äù by snapping photos with your webcam.

---

## Features

- **Camera-On-Click**  
  Clicking any password field opens your webcam inline‚Äîno separate dialog.

- **Face ‚Üí Emoji Mapping**  
  Uses [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) to detect your dominant expression (happy, sad, angry, etc.) and maps it to a corresponding emoji.

- **Backspace-Only Editing**  
  Password fields are `readonly` except for Backspace, so you can only remove emojis, never type letters or numbers.

- **Login & Sign-Up Workflows**  
  - **Sign-Up:** enter username, build an emoji-sequence in both password fields, submit.  
  - **Login:** enter username, re-build your emoji-sequence, submit.  
  Both forms validate presence and (for sign-up) matching emoji sequences.

- **Modern UI & Glassmorphism**  
  Frosted-glass card, gradient background, smooth slider tabs, and minimalist controls.
